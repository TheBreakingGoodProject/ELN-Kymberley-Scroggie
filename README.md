# Kymberley Scroggie's Electronic Laboratory Notebook

__Note: This ELN is not longer in use__

Kymberley (@kym834) is a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. She works within the [SCOPE](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group which is led by [Associate Professor Alice Motion](http://alicemotion.com/) (@alintheopen).

This ELN contains experiments conducted for [The Breaking Good Project](https://www.breakinggoodproject.com) - an international citizen science initiative that empowers members of the public to be active researchers in projects that will improve human health, and contributions to the [Open Source Mycetoma](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma) - a open science project working to find a novel treatment to eumycetoma. More information on the projects and the contributions store in this ELN can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/wiki).

The best way to find a relevant ELN entry is to head to the [Compound IDs page](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/wiki/Compound-IDs) where you can view compounds, their identifiers, which project they belongs to and all the ELN entries for it. Once you've identified a compounds you click the links to view the ELN entries or head over to the projects wiki page to find out more about the project the compound is relevant to.

## Experimental Identifiers

Experiments conducted for Open Source Mycetoma are identified as follows:
1. First three characters are KRS (initials of the experimentalist)
2. Underscore
3. Three numbers which are the main identifier of the molecule
4. Underscore
5. Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number 

For example, KRS_029_03 describes the third repeat/attempt at the synthesis of molecule 029 conducted by Kymberley.

Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:
1. Year of program
2. Underscore
3. Program the molecule is being synthesised for e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
4. Underscore
5. One letter followed by a number - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
6. Underscore
7. Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number

For example, 2022_BG_1J_002 describes the second attempt at the synthesis of molecule 1J for the core Breaking Good program ran in 2022.

## ELN Pages

On the main issues page, issues are sorted into _open_ and _closed_. _Open_ issues represent experiments that are planned or in progress, while _closed_ issues represent experiments that have been completed or abandoned. 

Issues are labelled with labels that describe the aim and status with descriptions of these labels contained in the [labels](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/labels) tab.

When experiments are complete the issue is "closed".

## Data

All raw and processed characterisation data is stored in the file [Characterisation Data](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/tree/master/Characterisation%20Data) above and is filed based on the experiment identifier.
