# Kymberley Scroggie's Electronic Laboratory Notebook

__Note: This ELN is not longer in use__

Kymberley (@kym834) is a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. She works within the [SCOPE](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group which is led by [Associate Professor Alice Motion](http://alicemotion.com/)(@alintheopen).

This ELN contains experiments conducted for [The Breaking Good Project](https://www.breakinggoodproject.com) - an international citizen science initiative that empowers members of the public to be active researchers in projects that will improve human health, and contributions to the [Open Source Mycetoma](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma) - a open science project working to find a novel treatment to eumycetoma. More information on the projects and the contributions store in this ELN can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/wiki).

The best way to find a relevant ELN entry is to start in the Wiki where you can identify the compound/s and which project it belongs to. Opening the project it belongs to in the Projects tab then gives you a list of all the issues that are relevant to that project. Here you can look for those with the identifier for the molecule of interest. Clicking on a given title will take you to the issue for the ELN entry. Each title is categories based on its status - to-do, in progress, complete.

Experiments conducted for Open Source Mycetoma are identified as follows:
1. First three characters are KRS (initials of the experimentalist)
2. Underscore
3. Three numbers which are the main identifier of the molecule
4. Underscore
5. Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number 

For example, KRS_029_03 describes the third repeat/attempt at the synthesis of molecule 029 conducted by Kymberley.

Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:
1. Year of program
2. Underscore
3. Program the molecule is contributing to e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
4. Underscore
5. One letter followed by a number - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
6. Underscore
7. Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number

For example, 2020_BG_1J_002 describes the second attempt at the synthesis of molecule 1J for the core Breaking Good program ran in 2022.

Issues are labelled with labels that describe the aim using the following:
* __New reaction__ - the first attempt at a reaction
* __Repeat__ - a repeat of a reaction already attempted/completed (the number of the repeat is described in the identify, see above).
* __Reaction optimisation__ - an experiment which is aiming to optimise the previous attempt/s
* __Upscale__ - an experiment where the amount of material has been increased from the first attempt

and with labels that describe the status
* __Reaction in progress__ - an experiment that is currently running
* __Purification__ - an experiment that has finished and is awaiting purification
* __Characterisation__ - an experiment that is complete with product that has been purified and has been used for characterisation experiments

When experiments are complete the issue is "closed".

All raw and processed characterisation data is stored in the file [Characterisation Data](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Kymberley-Scroggie/tree/master/Characterisation%20Data) in the "Code" tab and is filed based on the experiment identifier.
